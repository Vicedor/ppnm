Coefficients for exponential fit is f(t) = 141.333899083703*exp(-0.172070796448845 * t)
The uncertainties are da = 1.03223389525789 and dlambda = 0.004029186777016
This gives a half-life of 4.02826740426002 pm 0.0965870405028024 days
Compare this to the current estimate of the half-life of Ra-224:
3.632 days (according to Wolfram Alpha)
So it's of the same order of magnitude, but still a little off. Not bad for a first experiment though
